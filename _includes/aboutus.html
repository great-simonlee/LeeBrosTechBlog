      Over the past years, I have become very curious about maybe the biggest
      community ever throughout the entire world, "WEB". After the Columbia
      University Coding Bootcamp, I was, fortunately, able to go through a broad
      range of web development from front-end to back-end. Especially,
      three-team projects let me know how to collaborate with team members to
      create a solid complete website via GitHub.

      Skills: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, Typescript, Jquery, ReactJS,
      Git, WordPress
