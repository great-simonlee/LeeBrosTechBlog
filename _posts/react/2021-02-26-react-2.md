## 4. React Folder Structure

`yarn create react-app [project name]` is to create a react project using yarn.

`public` folder contains the static files which will not be changed once an user download from the server. e.g., html, txt, and img.

`src` folder contains the files that dynamically interact with the users over the website. e.g., javascript, css, etc.

`webpack` gives the files versions when the users download the files from the server. And, the files are saved in the cache so that the users no need to download the exact same files again.

`import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';`

Calling ReactDOM (class) from react-dom (library).

`react-dom` package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if you need to. Most of your components should not need to use this module.
