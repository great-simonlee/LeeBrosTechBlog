## 1. OOP (Object-oriented programming)

- <strong>Property (AKA Field)</strong> is a set of data in an object.
- <strong>Method</strong> is a set of functions defined in an object.
- <strong>Class</strong> is a kind of a template declared once with no data inside.
- <strong>Object</strong> is an instance of a class created many times with data inside.

## 2. OOP 4 Principles

#### (1) Encapsulation

Data sets and functions that are mutually dependent can be grouped in an object.

#### (2) Abstraction

No need to thoroughly understand how functions (methods) in an obejct work. Developers can use them without having to deeply touch the functions in the object.

#### (3) Inheritance

New objects (Or, maybe some new functions in an object) can be made based on the data sets and functions that are already declared as an object.

#### (4) Polymorphism
