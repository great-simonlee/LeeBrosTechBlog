## 1. Crypto Currency

<strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. Youâ€™ll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.

Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. <strong>Blockchain</strong> is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security.

## 2. TypeScript Setting

`yarn init` and the config in `package.json`
This will run the prestart then start.
{% highlight typescript %}

    "name": "typechain",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Learning Typescript by making a Blockchain with it",
    "main": "index.js",
    "license": "MIT",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js",
        "prestart": "tsc"
    }

{% endhighlight %}

Create a file with name `tsconfig.json`
{% highlight typescript %}

    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "ES2015",
        "sourceMap": true
    },
    "include": [
        "index.ts"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "node_modules"
    ]

{% endhighlight %}

`yarn add tsc-watch --dev`
tsc-watch can detect the ts file only internally. If you install TypeScript globally before, it would not work for the ts-watch.
