## 1. Retina Logo

The original logo file (preferably .png file) should be saved in the media library. Also, the retina logo file should be saved in the same folder with the name ending with \_x2.png.
For example, if the logo file is `logo.png`, the retina file should be saved in the same folder with the name `logo_x2.png`.

## 2. Mixed Contents

{% highlight html %}
Mixed Content: The page at '<URL>' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an
insecure element '<URL>'. This request was automatically upgraded to HTTPS
, For more information see <URL>
{% endhighlight %}

This error occurs because of the security issue of the HTTP. This can be solved with the SSL on the wordpress website. But, it may depend on the version of the google chrome that the users are using.
