## 1. 404 Error

A 404 page is a landing page that tells your site viewers the requested page is unavailable or, in some cases, doesn't exist. A 404 error tells users the page cannot be accessed â€“ and it can be a major problem.

The 500 Internal Server Error is a very general HTTP status code that means something has gone wrong on the web site's server but the server could not be more specific on what the exact problem is.

## 3. Mixed Contents

According to Google, mixed content occurs when HTML on a website loads over a secure HTTPS connection (thanks to a recently installed SSL certificate) but other content, such as images, video content, stylesheets, and scripts, continue to load over an insecure HTTP connection.
